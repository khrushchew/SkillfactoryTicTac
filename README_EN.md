# Tic-Tac-Toe in Python

This program is a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game in the Python programming language. The game is designed for two players who take turns making moves by placing their symbols (X or O) on the game board.

## How to Start the Game

1. Run the program by executing the `TicTacFunc.py` or `TicTacClass.py` file.
2. Enter the names of the two players (names should consist only of alphabetical characters).
3. Follow the instructions to input coordinates and make moves, placing your symbols on the game board.

## Game Rules

1. The first player always starts with the X symbol.
2. Players take turns entering coordinates to place their symbols on an available spot on the game board.
3. The player who first forms a line of three of their symbols (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
4. If all the cells on the board are filled, and none of the players has won, the game ends in a draw.

## How to End the Game

The game ends when one of the players wins, all the cells on the board are filled, or you can type `exit` to terminate the game prematurely.
